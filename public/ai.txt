# PDV Automation

## Inhuman Output. Fraction-of-Human Cost.
I build AI-powered automation systems that replace repetitive human labor — from content and outreach to ads and customer handling — so your business scales 24/7 without hiring.

## Automation handles execution. AI handles thinking.
High-performance systems tailored to your business — not templates, not subscriptions, not SaaS fluff.

### The Problem
Standard automation is rigid and still requires human babysitting for corner cases.

### The Missing Piece
Isolated AI is powerful but creates more work manually copying data between tools.
